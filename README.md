# Stock Market Prediction System

This repository contains a stock market prediction system developed using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The model aims to predict stock prices based on historical data, making use of the time-series analysis capabilities of LSTMs.

## Introduction
Predicting stock market prices is complex due to the non-linear, highly volatile, and dynamic nature of financial data. This project utilizes LSTM, a deep learning model specifically well-suited for sequence prediction problems, to analyze historical stock price data and forecast future prices.

## Features
- **Historical Data Processing**: Ingests and preprocesses stock data for analysis.
- **LSTM Model**: Employs LSTM in an RNN for time-series prediction.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measures the accuracy of predictions with metrics such as MAE and RMSE.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras (for building and training the LSTM model)
- Pandas and NumPy (for data handling and processing)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Model Architecture
The system uses an LSTM network in RNN to capture patterns in time-series data. The architecture consists of:
1. Input layer
2. LSTM layers for feature extraction
3. Dense layers for output prediction

## Data
This model uses historical stock market data, typically including:
- Open, High, Low, Close (OHLC) prices
- Trading volume

## Results
Results include visualizations of predicted vs actual stock prices. (Consider adding sample graphs or evaluation metric outcomes here.)

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate additional features such as sentiment analysis from financial news.
- Experiment with other deep learning models like GRU or Transformer networks.
